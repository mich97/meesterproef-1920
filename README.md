![IMG](./thumbnaill.png)

I have picked the praise-app to be my project, along with 4 other teammates we worked 5 weeks on creating a whole new frontend experience for Lyvup and we are all very happy to share our work!

## Prototype repo/link
Check out the [Repository](https://github.com/StefanGerrits2/Lyvup-prototype) for our prototype or the [live link](https://lyvup.herokuapp.com/).

## Assignment
The assignment was divided in 2 parts by Lyvup, each having their own unique purpose.

### 1. Redesign of the current front-end
Lyvup already has a running application, one of our jobs was to take every page from the current app and redesign it's whole front-end giving it a new look and feel.

### 2. The lunchbox (onboarding wizard)
The second part of the assigment was to develop what they originally called 'The Lunchbox', which is a onboarding wizard for new users give them just a little taste of Lyvup is like. The lunchbox is supposed to encourage someone to pay for the premium version of Lyvup.
